## Explanation:

Use Case:
In the manufacturing industry, automation with IoT devices and embedded controllers can improve production, reduce downtime, and optimize energy efficiency.

**Scenario:**
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.

**Target Audience:**
Manufacturing companies in automotive, electronics, and food processing sectors.

**Objectives:**

* Improve production efficiency by 30%.
* Minimize downtime through predictive maintenance.
* Enable real-time monitoring and remote control.
* Reduce energy consumption through process optimization.

## Evaluation Method (Rubrics):

| Criteria              | Excellent (5)                       | Good (4)        | Average (3)         | Poor (2)        | Very Poor (1)  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **Clarity of Prompt** | Prompt is clear and well-structured | Mostly clear    | Some ambiguity      | Confusing       | Unclear        |
| **Relevance**         | Directly fits scenario/objectives   | Mostly relevant | Partially relevant  | Weak connection | Not relevant   |
| **Creativity**        | Highly original and practical       | Good creativity | Somewhat creative   | Low creativity  | No creativity  |
| **Applicability**     | Easily applied in real use case     | Applicable      | Limited application | Hard to apply   | Not applicable |
| **Conciseness**       | Well-balanced and concise           | Slightly wordy  | Manageable          | Too wordy       | Very wordy     |

👉 Based on rubric evaluation, all five prompts score between **4–5** in clarity, relevance, and applicability. Prompt refinement shows improvement in conciseness and usability.
